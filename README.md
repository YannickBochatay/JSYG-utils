# JSYG-utils
Many features added to [JSYG-wrapper](https://github.com/YannickBochatay/JSYG-wrapper)

### Installation
You probably don't need to install this module individually.
It's a brick of [JSYG framework](https://github.com/YannickBochatay/JSYG).
You may be insterested by [JSYG.FullEditor](https://github.com/YannickBochatay/JSYG.FullEditor), a full svg editor API.
If you want to install it anyway : 
```shell
npm install jsyg-utils
```
